# Welcome to Inverse Problems and Imaging

In these lectures we introduce basic concepts related to inverse problems and visit various viewpoints on inverse problems. The main recurring themes are

* Modelling
* Analysis
* Solution strategies
* Applications

Each chapter contains exercises and example code in Python.

An overview of the lectures is given below:

* **Lecture 1 - what is an inverse problem?** In this lecture we give an overview of the course and introduce the basic nomenclature.
* **Lecture 2 - Discrete inverse problems.** In this lecture we treat linear inverse problems in $\mathbb{R}^n$. It introduces most of the basic concepts that will be treated in more generality later.
* **Lecture 3 - Image processing.** In this lecture we give an overview of inverse problems arising in various imaging applications like microscopy.
* **Lecture 4 - Inverse problems in function spaces.** Here, we treat the concepts of the previous lecture in a more general setting.
* **Lecture 5 - A statistical perspective.** We revisit the finite-dimensional setting of lecture 2 and introduce a statistical (Bayesian) perspective on inverse problems.
* **Lecture 6 - Computed Tomography.** In this lecture, we treat the tomographic inverse problem, which arises in various applications ranging from electron microscopy to medical imaging.
* **Lecture 7 and 8 - Variational formulations.** In these lectures we treat well-posedness and optimality conditions of variational problems arising in inverse problems.
* **Lecture 9 - Wavefield tomography.** In this lecture we discuss various inverse problems involving the wave equation.
* **Lecture 10 and 11 - Numerical optimisation.** In these final two lectures we discuss various methods for solving variational problems.
