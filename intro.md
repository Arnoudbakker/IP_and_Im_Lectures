# Welcome to Inverse Problems and Imaging

In the subsequent chapters we introduce basic concepts related to inverse problems and visit various viewpoints on inverse problems. The main recurring themes are

* Modelling (chapters ...)
* Analysis (chapters ...)
* Solution strategies (chapters ...)

In chapter .. we treat some applications of inverse problems in more detail.

All of the concepts can be understood at a high level using only basic mathematics.

Each chapter contains exercises.

The chapters are also available as Jupyter notebooks, that allow you to see and re-use the code used to produce the examples. Some of the exercises explicitly refer to the Python code.
