# Welcome to Inverse Problems and Imaging

```{warning}
These lecture notes are currently still under construction.

In these lectures we introduce basic concepts related to inverse problems and visit various viewpoints on inverse problems. The main recurring themes are

* Modelling
* Analysis
* Solution strategies
* Applications

Each chapter contains exercises and example code in Python.

## A tour through the book in 10 Lectures

* **Lecture 1 - [What is an inverse problem?](./what_is)** In this lecture we give an overview of the course and introduce the basic nomenclature.
* **Lecture 2 - [Discrete inverse problems](./discrete_ip_regularization).** In this lecture we treat linear inverse problems in $\mathbb{R}^n$. It introduces most of the basic concepts that will be treated in more generality later.
* **Lecture 3 - [Application: Image processing](./image_processing).** In this lecture we give an overview of inverse problems arising in various imaging applications like microscopy.
* **Lecture 4 - [Inverse problems in function spaces](ip_function_spaces).** Here, we treat the concepts of the previous lecture in a more general setting.
* **Lecture 5 - [A statistical perspective](./statistical_perspective).** We revisit the finite-dimensional setting of lecture 2 and introduce a statistical (Bayesian) perspective on inverse problems.
* **Lecture 6 - Application: [Computed Tomography](tomography).** In this lecture, we treat the tomographic inverse problem, which arises in various applications ranging from electron microscopy to medical imaging.
* **Lecture 7 - [Variational formulations](variational_formulations).** In this lecture we treat well-posedness and optimality conditions of variational problems arising in inverse problems.
* **Lecture 8 - [Numerical optimisation](numerical_optimisation).** In these final two lectures we discuss various methods for solving variational problems.
* **Lecture 9 - Application: [Wavefield imaging](wavefield_imaging).** In this lecture we discuss various inverse problems involving the wave equation.
* **Lecture 10 - Recent advances.** In this final lecture we discuss some recent advances, such as Compressed Sensing or the use of Machine Learning to solve inverse problems.
